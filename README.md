## filenav
A simple file navigator with support for accessing the entire directory structure, not just the Script Library. Additional features include automatic file icons depending on type, analysis of a few basic file attributes, and opening files directly in the default editor.

## filenav_plugin
Plugin for [ShellistaExt](http://github.com/briarfox/ShellistaExt) by [briarfox](http://github.com/briarfox) that adds a filenav command, which opens filenav in either the given or current directory.

## KeyboardControl
A proof-of-concept for using an external keyboard to control a UI script.

## PackUI
A means of distribution for .py and .pyui files without requiring any other scripts. The main script packages the two files into a new script, which will extract the files again when run.
